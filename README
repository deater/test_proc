These are some /proc/cpuinfo files I've collected over the years
in order to make debugging linux_logo easier.

Some of the machines I've owned or had accounts on, the rest 
are from postings on the net.


From Thomas Cort:

I wrote a library for reading cpuinfo files and found your data very
useful, thanks for putting it online. I have collected a lot of
cpuinfo files too. You can find them in CVS here:
http://cvs.savannah.nongnu.org/viewcvs/proccpuinfo/tests/data/?root=proccpuinfo
There are files there from more obscure architectures (frv, m32r, and
others). If you are looking for even more data, genflags (
http://dev.gentoo.org/~robbat2/genflags/ ) has over 1000 files.


Changes:

14 November 2008:
+ re-organized x86 and x86_64 directory.  Re-named to have
  family/model/stepping to avoid duplicates.
