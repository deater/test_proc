From Thomas Cort:

I wrote a library for reading cpuinfo files and found your data very
useful, thanks for putting it online. I have collected a lot of
cpuinfo files too. You can find them in CVS here:
http://cvs.savannah.nongnu.org/viewcvs/proccpuinfo/tests/data/?root=proccpuinfo
There are files there from more obscure architectures (frv, m32r, and
others). If you are looking for even more data, genflags (
http://dev.gentoo.org/~robbat2/genflags/ ) has over 1000 files.
